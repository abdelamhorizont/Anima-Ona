description: >
  Over a period of two years (2019-2022), we investigated the major construction
  site »Stuttgart 21« in an artistic-experimental way. The construction site was
  reinterpreted as an archaeological site. In the context of this work, we take
  on the role of excavators by photographically documenting the construction
  site, collecting finds,3D scanning them, archiving them, and examining them
  for their aesthetic and functional characteristics. In a kind of modern
  palimpsesting process, the finds were further processed, thus giving them a
  new value.
